# Apache Kafka Student Producer and Consumer.

This is a simple project showcasing the usage of Apache Kafka for producing and consuming messages related to a Student object. The project demonstrates how to set up a Kafka topic, produce Student objects to the topic, and consume them for display in the console.

You need to start Zookeeper and Kafka Server in order to consume the topic of the project.
